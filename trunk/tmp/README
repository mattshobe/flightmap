This folder holds files that are temporary in nature, but are needed and used
during a particular development phase.  Such files may include:
-  Notes and other documents (RFCs, research papers, specs) that were found
   useful at some point and influenced development.
-  Scripts or shortcuts (memos) used to generate temporary data (graphs,etc.)
-  Basically, anything one thinks may be worth sharing or saving, but which is
   NOT intended to be in the production environment.
