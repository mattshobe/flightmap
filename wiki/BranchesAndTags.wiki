#summary For developers. How to work on the trunk and branches.
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />
= Introduction =

Most development happens on the main trunk, and the [http://code.google.com/p/flightmap/source/checkout code checkout instructions] tell you how to check out that code.

This page will tell you how to switch between the `trunk` and other branches. It also tells you how to work with tags.

= One Working Directory =

Once you've done the EclipseSetup, you don't want to repeat that for each branch you work on. The recommended way of development is to have one working directory for all your development, and use the `svn switch` command to switch between them. That way you can keep Eclipse pointed at the one working directory.

These instructions will assume your working directory is `~/src/flightmap`. Adjust appropriately if you've chosen a different working directory.

= Branches =

We create branches for each release. These are typically short-lived, just for release-related details that don't belong on the main trunk (such as setting the version number, or making a quick release-specific fix).

= How To... =

All the examples below use `https` which provides read-write access to subversion. If you're not on the commiters list, and therefore only have read-only access, change the `https` to `http`.

== Check out the main trunk ==

See the [http://code.google.com/p/flightmap/source/checkout code checkout instructions].

== Switch your working directory to trunk ==
{{{
cd ~/src/flightmap
svn switch https://flightmap.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
}}}

== Switch your working directory to a branch ==
{{{
cd ~/src/flightmap
svn switch https://flightmap.googlecode.com/svn/branches/the-branch-name
}}}

== Determine if your working directory points to trunk or a branch ==
{{{
cd ~/src/flightmap
svn info | grep URL:
}}}

== Merge a change from trunk to a branch ==
Typically this down to cherry pick one specific revision's change down to a release branch.

  # Ensure you have no pending changes. `svn status` reports nothing pending.
  # *switch your working dir to the branch* as described above.
  # Now let's say r42424242 was a change on the trunk that you want to merge to the branch. Do the following:
{{{
svn merge -c42424242 https://flightmap.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
}}}

Now the changes from r42424242 are pending changes in your working directory. You can edit them as needed. When you're ready to commit them to the branch, then submit with a comment that identifies the source of the change. For example, r258 was a merge from trunk to a release branch. Here's the command used to submit it.
{{{
svn ci -m"Merged fix for issue 62 to release branch (from trunk r257)"
}}}
