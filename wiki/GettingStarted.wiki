#summary How to start developing with Flight Map.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =
Flight Map is an Android application that provides a moving map for VFR situational awareness for pilots.

Ant build files are used so you can use any IDE you'd like. See the [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/other-ide.html Developing in Other IDEs] page for more information.

If you use Eclipse, the see the EclipseSetup instructions.

= Prerequisites =
Flight Map developers will need the following things installed:
  * [http://developer.android.com/sdk/ Android SDK] 2.2 (API level 8) or higher
    * Recommended install location on Linux/Mac is `/usr/local/android`
  * [http://developer.android.com/sdk/tools-notes.html Android SDK Platform Tools]
  * [http://ant.apache.org/ Apache Ant] 1.8 or higher
  * [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/ Java SDK] 1.6 or higher
  * An SD card in your Android emulator or actual device.

You must add the `tools` and `platform-tools` directories of the Android SDK to your PATH.
= Get the Source =
See the [http://code.google.com/p/flightmap/source/checkout Source] page for details on how to check out the code.
== Subversion auto properties ===
For HTML pages generated by javadoc to be readable from the browser, the corresponding `svn:mime-type` has to be set by subversion.  You probably want to make sure the following lines are in your `~/.subversion/config` file:
{{{
enable-auto-props = yes
[auto-props]
*.html  = svn:eol-style=native;svn:mime-type=text/html
*.css = svn:eol-style=native;svn:mime-type=text/css
}}}

= Build =
== Android Code ==
The code that is deployed to the phone is in the `android` directory. See ProjectDirectories for information on the directory structure.

=== Configure your local build ===
Before you can build for the first time, you need to run this command *once* from the `flightmap` top-level directory.
{{{
android update project -p android
}}}
This will create a file called `android/local.properties` which points to your sdk install location. 

*TODO* Take care of this automatically in a top-level build.xml.

=== Build and install to emulator (or real device) ===
Execute these commands to build a debug version of the Android `.apk` file and install it to a running android emulator.
{{{
cd android
ant install
}}}

Before running the application, see the [GettingStarted#Copy_Data Copy Data] section below.

=== Troublshooting android build problems ===
If the build fails with this error: `taskdef class com.android.ant.SetupTask cannot be found` that means you didn't read the instructions above under *Configure your local build*

== Preprocessing Code ==
This is code that parses the aviation data from public sources, such as the FAA and puts it into a format that Flight Map can use. This code is not deployed to the phone. The preprocessing code is in the `preprocessing` directory.

Build it like this:
{{{
cd preprocessing
ant
}}}

The preprocessing code is used to create the `data/aviation.db` SQLite database.

= Copy Data =
== Emulator Set Up ==
Create an emulated device with an SD card that has at least 64 MB of storage space and uses Android SDK level 7 (version 2.1).

Here's an example of how to create an emulated device with SD card storage.
{{{
$ android create avd --name droid --target android-7 --skin WVGA800 --sdcard 64M
}}}

*IMPORTANT* Set the correct time zone in your emulator so that FlightMap doesn't think you've got a very old GPS update. GPS locations more than 5 minutes old are ignored. Home > Settings > Date & time settings.
  * Uncheck "Automatic"
  * Set the correct time zone (which will probably fix the time).

== Actual Device Set Up ==
Details on how to connect your development device to your computer are [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html here]. Once you've connected your device via USB, you can test that it's working like this:
{{{
$ adb devices
List of devices attached 
HT9C7P800556	device
}}}

If you don't see any devices listed, you didn't set it up right. Make sure you enabled USB debugging on your device.
