#summary Description of what is in each project directory.

= Introduction =

The Flight Map code is split into multiple top-level directories. This needed because although the main output of this project is an Android application, we also have supporting code that is not meant to go on the phone. There is also some common code that is shared between the code that goes on the phone and the supporting code.
