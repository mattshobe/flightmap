=Flight Map - Google Dogfood Edition - Release Notes=

==Intro==
Flight Map is an Android application created by Googler pilots who wanted to build a fun, simple-to-use aid to navigation and fair-weather pilotage. It is in its absolute earliest stages of development/feature maturity, but it's ready for pilots and other interested parties to dogfood in flight.

Flight Map offers these features:
  *  Works in *Airplane Mode*. All the data is kept locally on your phone.
  *  Current track, speed, and altitude
  *  GPS-plotted position on a moving, zoom-able map with nearby airport display
  *  Detailed airport/facility information available by tapping on airports shown on screen 
  *  Pilot-controlled settings for north/track up orientation, facility types to display
  *  Automatic facility database download and updating (data currently provided from official FAA sources; others are being considered)

We plan to add the following features in future releases:
  *  Record and save in-flight GPS tracks using the Android MyTracks application, if installed
  *  Terrain, road, and water detail layers in 2D mode
  *  Separate Airport/Facility database browse and search
…and the big one: a Sky Map-like augmented reality view through the device camera that can help reveal airports. Here is a [https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/blackbox/home/user-experience conceptual screenshot]. 

==Find bugs? Awesome. Tell us everything.==
Please file a bug using our official [http://code.google.com/p/flightmap/issues/list issues list] on the Google code site. (There are multiple bugs filed already – be sure to double-check for duplicates).

Also, you should consider joining the Flight Map [http://g/flightmap mailing list]. The development team will monitor this list for discussion and provide updates on development plans and launch timetables through it.

=Coming Soon=
  * Navaids
  * AWOS/ASOS frequencies
  * State Boundaries.

=Release: v0.13.0 "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dufaux_4 Dufaux 4]" - 1/30/11=
  * New features:
    * Controlled airspace contours are now displayed.  Issue 80.
      * Airspace more than 500 feet from your current altitude is dimmed.
  * Improvements:
    * Airport communication frequencies are better organized:
      * Merged tower and CTAF frequencies when possible.  Issue 135.
      * Removed trailing zeroes from CTAF frequencies.  Issue 134.
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed null pointer exception if the user selected an airport without communication frequencies.  Issue 146.

=Release: v0.11.1 "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooney_Airplane_Company  Mooney]" - 1/14/11=
  * Improvements:
    * Better pinch-to-zoom behavior. If you pan your fingers while pinching, the map pans.
    * Preserve pan state and panned-to map location when app is restored (such as when changing orientation).
  * Bug fixes:
    * Fixed null pointer exception if the user panned the map when there was no current location.
=Release: v0.11.0 "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooney_Airplane_Company Mooney]" - 12/20/10=
  * New features:
    * Can install to SD card (requires Android 2.2).
    * Pan the map by dragging.
    * Pinch to zoom in or out.
    * *Much* improved airport communication frequency information.
    * Better organization of search results.
    * Local search history.

=Release: v0.9.0 "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citabria Citabria]" - 10/15/10=
  * New features:
    * Search by airport code, city name or airport name.
      * Known issues with search:
        # Performance can be slow when there are lots of matches.
        # Results are not sorted in a useful way.
        # User preferences (e.g. hide heliports) are not applied to the search results.
    * Simulator mode. Useful for testing, but can also help you explore how the app works on the ground.
      * To use the simulator:
        # Enable the simulator preference (Menu > Prefs > Enable Simulator). You only have to do this once. We chose to hide the simulator by default.
        # Bring up the simulator control dialog (Menu > Sim). Check the "Activate simulator" box to start simulating flight.
        # Set the desired speed, track and altitude and the airplane will move. A flashing "SIMULATOR" indicator will appear on the map to remind you that you're in simulator mode.
    * Larger icons and text on the map screen.
      * We're still experimenting with how the map should look, so please give us your feedback on this.
    * Faster map updates.
      * New code can interrupt a slow database query that is no longer needed. Issue 95.
    * Rounded scale text.  Issue 120.
  * Bug fixes
    * As zoom in, scale icon gets shorter, but continues to display "1nm".  Issue 100.

=Release: v0.7.2 - 10/8/10=
  * Bug fixes
    * Speed sometimes jumps to 250+ knots (when going much slower than that).  Issue 10.
    * Time to airport in tapcard needs to provide a more general estimate. Issue 97.
    * In tapcard, last digits of frequencies are hidden. Issue 90.
    * In tapcard, comm frequencies are too close to station identifier. Issue 109.

=Release: v0.7.1 - 9/30/10=
  * Bug fixes
    * Database was getting corrupted during download.  Issue 101.
    * When zooming in/out, previously displayed airports were not filtered correctly.  Issue 108.

=Release: v0.7.0 - 9/24/10=
  * Bug fixes
    * Screen stays on the airport details page. It was already kept on on the map page.
      * General decision: any page that updates automatically with map or navigation data will keep the screen on.
    * Map incorrectly rotated by magnetic variation amount. Issue 89.
    * Show integer scale values and make zoom scale more visible. Issue 77.
    * Better visibility of text on the airport details page. Issue 75.
    * Move zoom scale control so it doesn't overlap with zoom scale text. Issue 45.
  * New functionality
    * Database query to fetch airports in view is on a separate thread.
      * After changing zoom levels, airports may appear or disappear based on their ranking.
      * Currently no indication to user of areas of the screen with database queries in progress.
    * Search by airport code (later name, city, etc.)
    * Aviation database is only updated on schema changes or if data is past its expiration date.
      * Database downloads cannot be interrupted by hitting the "back" button.

=Release: v0.5.1 - 9/9/10=
  * Bug fixes
    * Solves reported issue:  "Database update failed" error dialog would appear even though download completed successfully.

=Release: v0.5.0 - 9/2/10=
Initial dogfood release.
  * Known issues
    * Communication frequency data for airports is widely incomplete/inconsistent. This is our #1 motivator for a better data source.
    *  GPS-derived altitude reads 100 feet low on Nexus One (this inaccuracy may occur on other hardware, too).
    *  GPS-derived ground speed is sometimes very wrong, especially when changing altitude.
    *  Facility database download continues in the background even if the application is closed prior to completion.
    * Map view when standing still or moving slowly (e.g., walking or taxiing very slowly) is a bit erratic. The view may shift position unexpectedly until you are moving at a more consistent speed.
