#summary Flight Map v0.5 Release Notes


=Flight Map v0.5 - Google Bazaar Dogfood Edition - Release Notes=

==Intro==
Flight Map is an Android application created by Googler pilots who wanted to build a fun, simple-to-use aid to navigation and fair-weather pilotage. It is in its absolute earliest stages of development/feature maturity, but it's ready for pilots and other interested parties to dogfood in flight.

FlightMap offers these features in v0.5:
  *  Current heading, speed, and altitude
  *  GPS-plotted position on a moving, zoom-able map with nearby airport display
  *  Detailed airport/facility information available by tapping on airports shown on screen 
  *  Pilot-controlled settings for north/track up orientation, facility types to display
  *  Automatic facility database download and updating (data currently provided from official FAA sources; others are being considered)

In future releases, we're planning for the following features:
  *  Ability to record and save in-flight GPS tracks using the Android MyTracks application, if installed
  *  Multitouch pan and zoom of the display map
  *  Terrain and water detail layers in 2D mode
  *  Separate Airport/Facility database browse and search
â€¦and the big one: a Sky Map-like augmented reality view through the device camera that can help reveal airports. See https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/blackbox/home/user-experience for a conceptual screenshot. 

==Known Issues: v0.5==
  *  GPS-derived altitude reads 100 feet low on Nexus One (this inaccuracy may occur on other hardware, too)
  *  Facility database download continues in the background even if the application is closed prior to completion
